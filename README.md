# 📍 Data Science Projects 
- This repository contains all unique projects I worked on during my masters of business analytics and data science degree at the University of Cincinnati
- Over the course of my studies / career you will be able to see the progression of where I started and how much I've grown since
- Enjoy 🚀

# 🍷🍇 Wine Quality Exploratory Data Analysis 
- This project contains four separate parts analyzing the classic [wine quality data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)
- This was one of the first projects I worked on demonstrating statistical methods for EDA 
- Descriptive statistics, visualization, sampling methods and other common techniques were used
- Half of this project was done in python, the other half was completed in R

# 👾 Tech Company Revenue
- Another one of my very first projects done in python analyzed a small data set from kaggle as part of a class
- This was an introduction to data science, but the main focus was to demonstrate proficiency in python scripting
- We were to manually extract the data and put the columns into rows and lists using key-value pairs and compute statistics without using powerful libraries
- After manually wrangling the data, we then used common libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib) to quickly compute the same stats
