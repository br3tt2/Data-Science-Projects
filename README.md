# 📍 Data Science Projects 
- This repository contains all unique projects I worked on during my masters of business analytics and data science degree at the University of Cincinnati
- Over the course of my studies / career you will be able to see the progression of where I started and how much I've grown since
- Enjoy 🚀

# 🏡 AIRBNB Home Price Prediction (in-progress) (April 2024)

# 🍎 CNN Apple Image Classifier (in-progress) (March 2024)

# 🪼 Mood Disorder Classification 🦑 (Feb 2024)
- Classification algorithms applied to a data set to predict 4 different mood disorders based on various predictors
- Decision trees and random forests used
- sklearn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib

# 🍷🍇 Wine Quality Exploratory Data Analysis (Sept 2023)
- This project contains four separate parts analyzing the classic [wine quality data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)
- This was one of the first projects I worked on demonstrating statistical methods for EDA 
- Descriptive statistics, visualization, sampling methods and other common techniques were used
- Half of this project was done in python, the other half was completed in R

# 👾 Tech Company Revenue (April 2023)
- Another one of my very first projects done in python, which analyzed a small data set from kaggle. This was a final assignment in my introduction to python course
- This was an introduction to data science, but the main focus was to demonstrate proficiency in python scripting
- We were to manually extract the data and put the columns / rows into lists & dictionaries using key-value pairs and compute statistics without using powerful libraries
- After manually wrangling the data, we then used common libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib) to quickly compute the same stats
